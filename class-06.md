Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library. The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.
