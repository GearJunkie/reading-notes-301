# Reading Notes 301

## Rest

### Employee performance optimization

- analyzing and improving individual workers

- wasn't enough though, or as effective, as individual workers are being grouped into project teams

### Researching group patterns/norms

- A group of "average" skillset/qualified/intelligence individuals could outperform a group of "high" skillset/qualified/intelligence individuals

- Group leadership played a role, but that role's variances did not have as much of an impact on the norms/patterns of the research

- Average social sensitivity  is a term to describe how an individual in a group/team is skilled at intuiting the feelings of others, based on their tone, expressions, and body language

- Psychological safety is a group culture, a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking, sharing their ideas without fear of harsh critique, and working through roadblocks in progress together without judgement or shame.

- Establishing a connection and showing social sensitivity within a team will foster psychological safety. How to establish these concepts is fluid and is based largely on the human element of the individuals in the team.
