## Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry:

Modern computer science is dominated by men. But it hasn't always been this way. A lot of computing pioneers — the people who programmed the first digital computers — were women. And for decades, the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. But in 1984, something changed. The percentage of women in computer science flattened, and then plunged, even as the share of women in other technical and professional fields kept rising.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company?

- Diverse teams are smarter and more creative.
- Diverse companies perform better.
- Companies are losing out on great talent.
- Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base.
- It’s the right thing to do.

While diversity and inclusion efforts are most often driven by business rationales, we’ve spoken with a few CEOs who are motivated primarily by a belief that cultivating an inclusive tech community is simply the right thing to do.

Some of these leaders have noted that the tech industry is creating vast opportunity and that by excluding certain groups from that opportunity the industry is perpetuating and exacerbating existing social inequality. Others have emphasized a concern that by failing to involve particular communities in the process of creating of new technology, we as a society lose out on the benefits of those community members’ ideas.
